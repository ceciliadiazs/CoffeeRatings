# CoffeeRatings

Avery Klauke, Justin Hartenstein, Cecilia Diaz

With coffee being consumed by 30-40% of the world's population daily and over 70 countries participating in its production, we aim to conduct an analysis of the factors contributing to the overall appeal of coffee. In this report, we introduce a linear regression model that depicts the relationships between the overall score of a cup of coffee and its distinct characteristics, as measured by experts in the field. This statistical approach is crucial for the understanding of key aspects that influence on coffee ratings. Moreover, it serves as a foundation to give recommendations on the attributes that contribute to a good cup of coffee. In the next sections we will expand on the methodology used to build the regression model as well as the discussion of our findings.

The data comes from TidyTuesday, who previously collected it from the Coffee Quality Database. The specific dataset used was provided by the Coffee Quality Institute in January 2018. It contains data on two types of coffee beans: Robusta and Arabica. Both of them are rated by professionals on several aspects like sweetness, acidity, fragrance and color. It includes 1,339 observations and 23 variables, four of which are categorical.
